						<p>Foldy is a simplified mobile first responsive grid. It's based on the <a href="http://960.gs">960 Grid</a>, and is designed for people (like us at <a href="http://paravelinc.com">Paravel</a>) who are transitioning into Responsive Web Design.</p>
						<p> It's ugly on purpose. It's not a framework or a drop-in solution, it's a starting point. It's a <del>learning tool</del> <ins>launch pad</ins> that is made to be customzied.</p>

						Welcome to the city of lies where everything's got a price

						You can be a movie star and get everything you want
						Just put some plastic on your face
						
						
						
						
						This place is a circus,
						 you just see the surface
						They cover shit under the rug
						You can't see they're fakin', they'll never be naked
						
						
						Just fill your drink with tonic gin, this is the American dream, so
						
						
						Sip the gossip, drink 'til you choke
						Sip the gossip, burn down your throat
						
						
						You're not iconic, you are just like them all
						Don't act like you don't know, so
						
						
						Sip the gossip, drink 'til you choke
						Sip the gossip, burn down your throat
						You're not iconic, you are just like them all
						Don't act like you don't know, oh
						
						
						Keep drinkin' and acting cool, don't care if your day is blue
						Nobody loves a gloomy face, just
						Take your pills and dance all night, don't think at all, that's the advice
						So c'mon, let's try, it's just a taste

  				<p>One common task in responsive web design is making a grid of thumbs collapse into a 2-column grid. Foldy makes this easy. 6 is the magic number. And it should be easy enough to understand how the simplified grid works that you could modify it yourself.</p>
